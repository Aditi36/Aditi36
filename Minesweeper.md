Day 1: Read about the documentations over agile methodology and minesweeper.

                                               Agile and Scrum :-

    Agile software development refers to  software development methodologies centered round the idea of iterative development, 
    where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. 
    The ultimate value in Agile development is that it enables teams to deliver value faster, with greater quality and predictablity, and greater aptitude to respond to change. 
    Scrum and Kanban are two of the most widely used Agile methodologies. 
    
    Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one.
    A Scrum process is distinguished from other agile processes by specific concepts and practices, divided into the three categories of Roles, Artifacts, and Time Boxes.

    Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of 
    them with help from clues about the number of neighbouring mines in each field.
